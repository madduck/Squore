## Specifying the event details and match format

After you have entered (or selected) the names of the players, the Squore app offers you
the option to specify more details of the match.

In case of a 'Doubles' match you also have the option to specify the 'Sequence of Serve' used for the doubles match.

Note that if you do not want to specify an event, and the fields are e.g. already pre-filled for you, you can clear them by 'long clicking' on the label `Event`.
(And similarly you can clear the player fields by 'long clicking' the label `Players`, and clear the referee fields by 'long clicking' the label `Referee`.)
Alternatively the menu also offers _Clear player fields_, _Clear event fields_ and _Clear referee fields_ options.

## Correcting mistakes

If you realise that you have spelled a players name incorrectly or one of the event details,
you can simply correct it by choosing the menu option _Edit/Event-Player_.
(Or swipe back-and-forth over one of the player names)
