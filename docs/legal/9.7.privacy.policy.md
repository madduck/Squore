## Privacy Policy

The app may ask you to grant certain permissions:

### Contacts (Read your contacts)

If you grant the app this permission, your contacts are read only to to provide 'autocomplete' functionality when entering player names.
Phone numbers, email addresses or other private information stored in your contacts is not used by the app.

### Storage (Read the contents of your SD card, modify or delete the contents of your SD card)

This is used only during import and export functionality:
- If you want to export all matches previously reffed with the app, the app will create a zip file for you. 
    Depending on your preferences this zip file may be stored on internal or external storage.
- If you want to import a zip file with matches (e.g. previously create using the export functionality), the app will list the available zip files. 
    At that moment it allows you to remove zip files you do not want to use anymore.
