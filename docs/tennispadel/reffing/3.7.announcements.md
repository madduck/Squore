## Official announcements

If you like to make official announcements that should be made during a match, you can let the app help you.

## Micro button

By default, when appropriate a floating button with a microphone will appear.
If you press it, the dialog will guide you what announcement can be made.

* e.g. that it is (almost) time to change the balls
  * What 'pattern' should be used for ball change, can be set at the start of a match in the 'Format' section, with the 'New Balls' option:
    * After First  7 Then Each  9  
    * After First  9 Then Each 11
    * After First 11 Then Each 13
    * Before Set 3

## Automatic

If you like the app to automatically show the 'announcements', change the following setting 

* Settings > Behaviour > For official usage > Use announcement feature > ** Show Automatically **
