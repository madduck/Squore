## Bluetooth Mirror

If you have 2 blue tooth capable devices and have paired them, you can
* start Squore on both devices, then 
* 'Connect' the apps via bluetooth choosing the menu option `Bluetooth Mirror` on one of the devices
* In the dialog presented the other device should be available as an 'option' 

If successful, you can have the score and score changes maintained on one device be reflected on the other device.

E.g. while the ref holds a phone in his hands, put a paired android tablet on a table for the audience to see.
