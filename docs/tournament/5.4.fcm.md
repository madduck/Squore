## FCM

### Enable FCM and construct demo URL

To get started with FCM (FireBase Cloud Messaging), first enable FCM in the app: Settings > Internet > FCM
- Check 'FCM - Enable'.
- Note down the value specified at `FCM - Device Unique ID`

Close the settings.

Now open the FCM demo page <https://squore.double-yellow.be/fcm/XYZ123/help> where you should replace XYZ123 with your 'FCM - Device Unique ID'.

Optionally this unique URL can also be opened from the app using : Menu > Show > FCM - Info

But, the demo page is not very user-friendly on a small screen, so best open the URL on a computer full screen in a browser.

## The demo page

On the demo page verify your URL is correct (holds the correct device id) to change the score on your device, by clicking the different 'Go' buttons.

You should be able to 

- Change to score 
- Start new matches

If that all works, you can see what URL's are actually called 'under the hood' by clicking e.g. on the 'Copy link' buttons.

## Be creative

Up to you to be creative and use these URL's to control matches/scores on different devices remotely. 

I have seen users
- implement an Excel sheet with cells holding URL/links, to send e.g. match details (player names) to start a certain match on a specific device. 
- configure devices (attached to a racket) that can trigger a call to an URL, to trigger a score change on a device next to the court.
