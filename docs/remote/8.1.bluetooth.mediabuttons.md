Because of the fact that if you have the app open on both your wearable and your phone, the scores will stay in sync, you more or less have a 'remote control' for changing the score on your phone or tablet.

But there are other options. 
- Using bluetooth media control buttons (simple)
- Using FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

The latter is very flexible but harder to setup.
Contact the developer if you want more info about FCM.

Controlling the score via a device like this

![Bluetooth Media Buttons](../img/bluetooth.media.buttons.01.jpg)

is simple.

* Pair your phone/table with such a bluetooth device.
* Turn the option on in the app: *Settings > Behaviour > Scoring by Media Playback Buttons*

Now, when the app is in the foreground, you can control the score with the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons.
And you 'Undo' the score by pressing the 'Play/Pause' button.

I've heard of people either:

* wearing the button like a watch
* attaching the buttons somewhere on the side of the court/playing area
