* Select matches from web feeds (e.g. feeds containing matches from a tournament on [Tournamentsoftware](http://www.tournamentsoftware.com/sportselection/setsportselection/2?returnUrl=%2Ffind%2Ftournament%3Fid%3D2) )

But besides that it has several functions that might be to your liking. For example
* Use [timers](timers.md)
* [Customize colors](colors.md) e.g. to match your club/tournament colors
* Show scoring history in a [graph](graphs.md)
* Sharing the result (Link with entire score sheet, Message with summary, Email, or post to a website)
* Stores the entire scoring history for later referencing
