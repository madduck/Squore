## Remote controlling the score

You can control the score with some bluetooth LE devices.
Special attention as been given to making the app work with the D-SCORE wristbands.

There are several configuration options
- One wristband
    - one player is responsible for scoring for both players, 'green' button for one player/team, the 'red' button for the other
- Two wristbands, one per team : 
  - one team/player indicates 'I/We scored' with the 'green' button, then
  - opposing team confirms (or rejects) the score with the 'red' button
  - This is to prevent accidentally entering a score (deliberate accidental scoring is better known as 'cheating')  

The app will provided feedback for what 'stage' the scoring mechanism is in
- the score button of the player for which scoring is to be confirmed will 'pulsate'
- once confirmed, the score button of the scoring player will 'blink' a few times

To start using BLE devices, you need to scan for and connect them to the app:
- select the menu option 'BLE devices'
- Press 'Start Scan' to actually start scanning for devices (app will need and therefor may ask for certain permission to be granted)
  - if an error about missing permissions is shown you will need to grant some permissions manually. This is typically done with steps along this line:
    - long click the app icon and select 'App info'
    - in the next screen select 'App permissions'
    - select and allow 'Nearby Devices' as well as 'Location' for the app
  - if scanning starts but no devices seem to show up
    - your devices might currently not be 'broadcasting' their presence
      - for e.g. D-Score devices, you might need to 'wake' them by pressing the green button
    - your devices might already be connected to another app or device (a 'connected' BLE devices does not 'broadcast' their presence) 
- In the list of devices that show up
  - select the device you want to use for scoring by team A
  - select the device you want to use for scoring by team B
  - Note: depending on the used 'BLE' configuration 
    - you can select the same device for team A and B
    - you can only select the same device for team A and B
    - you can only select different devices for team A and B
