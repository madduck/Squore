## Install the app on your wear OS manually

>Because of the many WearOS devices, that exist out there, some steps described below might not match with steps needed for your specific device. 
But hopefully if will give enough guidance to get it installed on your specific WearOS device.
 
- Turn on `developer options` on your WearOS
  - Open the watch's Settings.
  - Tap `System > About` or `System > About > Versions` (depends on watch).
  - Tap the `Build number` item seven times quickly in succession.
  - A message appears confirming that you are now a developer.
- Now, under `System > Developer options` enable `ADB Debugging` and `Debug over Wi-Fi`
- Connect your Phone and WearOS to same Wi-Fi network
- Obtain ip address of WearOS device 
  - e.g. Settings > Connectivity > Wi-Fi > _Your Wi-Fi Network_ > IP address
  - note down the ip address (required in later step)
- Download the .apk file
  - browse to <https://squore.double-yellow.be/apks/index.php> on your phone 
  - download 'latest' apk file for WearOS onto your Phone by clicking the appropriate apk file 
- Now, Either use 'Wear Installer' or 'Bugjeager' android app to install the just downloaded apk file onto your WearOS device:

- 'Install/Finish/Restart' buttons should appear in Wear Installer app on your Phone, 
- press the 'Install' button 
  - Warning: Nothing much seems to happen according to app on phone 
- after several seconds (sometimes it may take up to a minute), on WearOS the app should appear as 'installed' and it can be started
- App on your phone (no feedback) can now be closed by pressing 'Finish'

**Bugjeager app**
 
Note: Apps Bugjeager (seems to have a LOT of adds)

- Install [Bugjeager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.sisik.hackendebug) app on your Phone
- open app on your Phone (agree with terms)
- Connect app to your WearOS
  - Next to 'no device connected' click on 'plug' icon
  - Enter the ip of your wear os, 
  - click connect
  - On your wear os 'confirm' the connection
  - the connection is now visible (typically by showing the ip address of your Wearable followed by port 5555)
- go to the 'packages' tab (3rd tab with 'up arrow')
- click on 'plus' icon, a floating button in bottom-right (close any popup add)
- choose `Select API file` and press `OK`
- select downloaded apk file 
- Wait for progress window to finish (`Package installed` message should appear at the bottom for short period of time)

**Finalize**

Once the app is installed on your WearOS it is best to turn off `ADB Debugging` on your WearOS
- under `System > Developer options` disable `ADB Debugging`
